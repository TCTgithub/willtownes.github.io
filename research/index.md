### Other/ Miscellaneous Interesting Stuff

#### Statistics
* Bayesian hierarchical modeling and probabilistic graphical models
* Bayesian nonparametrics
* Nonparametric and semiparametric statistics
* Variational Inference
* Spatial Statistics
* Missing Data

#### Computation
* Graph data (eg, gene regulatory networks), computing and stats on large, non-relational databases
* High-dimensional data techniques
* Machine Learning- I took a Coursera class on this and want to get a deeper, more theoretical understanding. I'd like to also trying some of the tools like elastic net, SVMs, etc. on different kinds of large datasets.
* The Julia programming language- I am fond of Python, but this new language is very exciting

#### Biology
* Gene co-expression and regulatory networks*
* Metagenomics- this seems like an exciting place for testing ecological hypotheses that could have relevance to health outcomes. For example, ecologists often debate whether diversity of a system affects its stability. I wonder if higher microbiome diversity is associated with stability? Or, in another example, is someone who eats a wide variety of types of food (such as an international traveler) more likely to have a diverse gut flora than someone who doesn't travel?
* Epigenetics
* Mental Health
* Cancer
* Infectious Disease- host genome to viral genome analysis, incorporating zoonotic host dynamics in evolutionary models
