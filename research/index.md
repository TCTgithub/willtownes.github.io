## Bio Sketch
I am a 1st year PhD student in Biostatistics at Harvard University. I am interested in biological problems that require both computational and statistical methods. My academic background is:

* B.S. Biology, Washington & Lee University. Studied abroad in Monteverde, Costa Rica
* Tropical Ecology research in Bataan, Philippines on a Fulbright grant
* M.S. Math and Statistics, Georgetown University. Completed while working full-time as a software tester

I am a fan of open source collaboration and plan on using software engineering techniques like automated testing, version control and continuous integration in my future research. Here are some things I would like to learn more about during my time in graduate school:

## Statistics
* Bayesian hierarchical modeling and probabilistic graphical models
* Bayesian nonparametrics, including all the stochastic processes theory beneath it (Dirichlet processes, etc)
* Nonparametric and semiparametric statistics in general.
* Generalized Estimating Equations.
* Variational Inference- I find this an intriguing alternative to MCMC
* Spatial Statistics (I love looking at maps)
    - How does the choice of projection affect things? Is there a way to do 3-D spatial stats measuring distance in great circles, etc.?
* Causal Inference- I don't know much about it currently but it seems interesting.
* Missing Data- I am somewhat familiar with the EM algorithm and the Bayesian approach of using "latent parameters" but I'd like to learn more about the state-of-the-art, and especially how to address computational issues that arise

## Computation
* building bioinformatics "pipelines"
* High-dimensional data techniques
* Machine Learning- I took a Coursera class on this and want to get a deeper, more theoretical understanding. I'd like to also trying some of the tools like elastic net, SVMs, etc. on different kinds of large datasets.
* Graph data (eg, social networks), computing and stats on large, non-relational databases
* The Julia programming language- I am fond of Python, but this new language is very exciting

## Biology
* Metagenomics- this seems like an exciting place for testing ecological hypotheses that could have relevance to health outcomes. For example, ecologists often debate whether diversity of a system affects its stability. I wonder if higher microbiome diversity is associated with stability? Or, in another example, is someone who eats a wide variety of types of food (such as an international traveler) more likely to have a diverse gut flora than someone who doesn't travel?
* Epigenetics- how can we measure epigenetic modifications?
* Mental Health
* Cancer
* Infectious Disease- everyone worries about Ebola, but Influenza is probably a bigger threat. I would like to learn more about statistical methods for inferring parameters of models like S-I-R.
